Python basic assignment 4

1.  It is a list which stores data of different datatypes and repetitioin is allowed

2.  spam[2] = "hello"

3.  'd'

4.  d

5.  ['a','b']

6.  1

7.  [3.14,'cat',11,'cat',True,99]

8.  [3.14,11,'cat',True]

9.  lists can be concatenated with + operator and lists can be replicated n times by using bacon * n

10.  append() inserts a value at the end of the list, hence no need the position parameter
     insert() inserts a value at any position in the list. So it has 2 main parameters, the position and the value

11.  bacon.remove('cat')
     bacon.pop(0)

12.  They are saved in a sequential manner and hence can be retrieved by their indexes

13.  Lists are mutable while tuples are immutable

14.  tup1 = (42,)

15.  l=[1,"abc",9]
     tuple(l)

     t=(1,45,"abc")	
     list(t)

16.  They can contain other variables as well and others variables can have list variables
     eg  t=(1,2,[7,8,9])


17.  copy.copy()  creates a new object and assigns all the values in the list/tuple to the new object in such a way that
     the address or reference of the original values are attached.
     copy.deepcopy() creates a new object with all values occupying new memory locations
