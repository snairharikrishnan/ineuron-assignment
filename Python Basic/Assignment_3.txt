Python Basic Assignment 3

1 Functions reduce the need for wring the code again and again.  
  It increases the reusability of our code just by calling those functions.
  It also helps us to split the whole work into small modules
  By using functions, we can easily read through the whole program unlike sequential commands

2 The code inside a function runs only when the function is called

3 A def statement creates a function eg.

  def test():
      pass


4 Function is the function defenition just as the example shown in question3
  Function call is when the program calls the function and it starts executing. eg test()

5  Global variables are those variables that are defines outside the functions and can be accessed by all functions
   Local variables are those which are defined inside a function and can be accessed only in that function

6  They get updated, but only that function can see that variable. Others dont know that this variable exists

7 return keyword sends back a value to where the function is called

Yes it is possible to have returned value in expression. eg
 
def abc(x):
    return x* 2


abc(5) + 10  --> 20

8  NO value is returned

9  Using the global keyword

10  None

11 It imports that package ie all functions that package will be available.
   If the package name does not exists, it throws error

12 spam.bacon()

13  Add a try except block 

14  All codes which has a possibility to crash can be written in try.
   If an error is encountered, control flows to except block.
   In except block we give the different errors and what to execute if such errors are encountered
